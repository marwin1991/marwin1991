### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Zmilczak and I am Fullstack Software Engineer. I enjoy programming the most when I can solve soneone's problem and the code is as perfect as I can make it. 
One of the greatest advantages of our industry in my opinion is the ability to share and transfer knowledge. I am `DevOps/Automate-everything Approach Lover` and `Stock Market Enthusiast`, feel free to contact me in any case using `peter.zmilczak@gmail.com` and if I will be able, I will be happy to help you ðŸ™‚.
